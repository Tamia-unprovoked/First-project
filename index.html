      Clarity
      <pre>Another one dead that's all reported in the news 
A right to an opinion but they shut down our views 
The 'stay at home' rule but no homes in the hood 
Our shacks were destroyed for flats
The hierarchy don't allow us to do shit 
Rich over needing anytime 

Racism arise, 
black ignorance is the excuse 
Poverty creeping in, 
the phrase 'don't panic'was misused
How do informal homes survive the don't's and do's? 
I mean the Cebu's aren't living lavish like the Peru's 
Please clarify, I'm confused 

21 days she's bruised it's her crime to refuse
Her dignity is removed by a man she looked to
After the pain she feed him does his laundry 
Picks up his bloody khakis 
It's still warm and sticky 
Her eyes were wet and sulky 
Her name is was Vicki 
School was escape from the rape
How is she gonna escape? 
Please clarify 

Don't tell me the needs of the few 
outweighs the needs of the many 
Lemme tell you about my cousin Jenni 
She works overtime for every penny 
She looks after her son Kenny 
She recently buried her granny
So she isn't left with plenty 
Her job closed down 
The grant is her hope 
but the police are being shity 
She forces her through, 
her son in mind not minding reality 
A shot in the head, no pity 
Rip Jenni she died at thirty 
Just another casualty 
Is this clear to you 
Or its misted like all the government decisions 
While they claim to be transparent 
'Cause all we can see is tinted black window 
With a voice shouting transparency behind it 

I hope this is clarity 
That this is no fatality 
It's an oppression to our mentality 
Their opportunity to deny responsibility 
In the sense of 'protecting the majority'

 Ndiyoyika
Ndoyika isphelo 
Jonga
Isizwe syaqothuka
Nam le ndyayothukha
Kuvutha amahlathi
Nemozulu ispheka isophula
Sihleli sibukele ilizwe liyabhubha
Utywala luyasduda
No lutsha luyaguga
OoTata bedlwegula
Oobhuti bebulala
Oomama bayakhala

Kanti siyobalekelaphi?
Emakhaya kuyaliwa
Xa kulalwa akutyiwa
Abantwana balambile

Enyansweni 
Ndiyoyika
Ndoyika isphelo 

Umhlaba uphelile
IRandi lehlile
Ukutya konyukile
Umrholo udengile

Kona kona
Ndiyoyika
Ndoyika isphelo

Izifo ezingalapheki
Amakholwa angakhuzeki
Amasela angabambeki
Izthembiso ezingafezeki

Ndiyoyika
Ndoyika isphelo </pre>

      A Wife
      <pre>As the ink flows in my veins
I write with my nails
I pour all the pain
I survive all the strain

A wife, it is.
Not human
Just a wife.

I wake up in the morning
Cook and clean
Bow to the rules
And walk on eggs

Afraid to complain
I gotta comply
Coz I got nothing
To the table I bring nothing

A wife, it is.
Not human
Just a wife

Put you above everything
Love you more than anyone
Coz I know you prolly the one
I knew it when I said hi 

But then.. 
Your strength overpowers me
Press onto my both hands 
While you penetrate in me
I screamed, I cried 
But you weren't hearing me 

I struggled, you wouldn't let go
I said no but you went on
Not just once or twice 
But the pain and suffer went on
All I want is to be free
